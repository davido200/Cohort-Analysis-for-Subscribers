## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing a cohort analysis to track the retention and churn rates of subscribers over a period of several weeks. The goal is to gain insights into subscriber behavior, identify patterns in retention, and understand when churn is most likely to occur. By analyzing these trends, strategies can be developed to improve customer retention and reduce churn.

## Data
The dataset consists of subscriber information, including their subscription start and end dates. For the cohort analysis, subscribers are grouped by their starting week (cohort week), and retention and churn rates are calculated over a 6-week period.

### Key Columns
- **cohort_week**: The week when the subscribers joined.
- **Week 0 to Week 6**: The retention rate for each cohort over a span of 6 weeks.
- **retention_rate_week_0 to retention_rate_week_6**: The retention rate for each cohort over a span of 6 weeks.

## Visualizations
Visualizations are utilized to illustrate both retention and churn rates, helping to identify trends and pinpoint areas where churn is highest and where subscribers are more likely to stay.

### Heatmaps
1. **Retention Heatmap**: Visualizes the percentage of subscribers retained over each week for different cohorts.
2. **Churn Rate Heatmap**: Visualizes the percentage of subscribers that churn each week across different cohorts.

You can access the visualization on **Subscribers Retention and Churn**.

## Key Insights
1. **Early Churn**: The highest churn typically occurs in the first two weeks, indicating that these weeks are critical for improving subscriber retention.
2. **Stable Retention**: After the initial drop-off in retention during the first two weeks, the retention rate stabilizes, and subscribers who remain are more likely to continue using the service.

## Recommendations
Based on the cohort analysis, the following recommendations are made:
- Focus on improving onboarding and engagement during the first two weeks to minimize churn.
- Enhance the customer experience for new subscribers to encourage long-term retention.

## Conclusion
This cohort analysis provides valuable insights into subscriber behavior and helps identify key areas for improving retention and reducing churn. By applying these findings, businesses can create targeted strategies to keep subscribers engaged and loyal.
